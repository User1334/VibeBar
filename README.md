---

###  Requirements

- macOS 12.4+  
- Apple Music app installed  
- Local Discord running (web version not supported)  

ðŸ’¡ *Full feature support (including all settings fields) requires macOS 13 or later. On macOS 12, only basic functionality and client ID editing are fully supported.*  

---

###  Installation

1. Download the latest `.dmg` file from [Releases](https://github.com/user1334/VibeBar/releases).
2. Move `VibeBar.app` to your `Applications` folder.
3. Launch it â€” and grant automation permissions when prompted.
4. Thatâ€™s it. Your vibes are now live.

---

###  Permissions

macOS will prompt you to grant automation access so VibeBar can read playback info from Apple Music. This is required for real-time updates.  

---

### Dynamic Covers  

If you enable dynamic album covers, VibeBar will check for the [loon](https://github.com/ungive/loon) proxy.  
- If not found, youâ€™ll be prompted to install it.  
- Installation may require Homebrew or a direct Go-based build.

### Custom Presence  

VibeBar allows you to configure your own Discord Rich Presence details (images, hover texts, and buttons).  

Hereâ€™s an example for the **Listening** presence type:

- **Large Image Key** â†’ The main image shown (usually album art or custom asset).  
- **Large Image Text (Hover)** â†’ Text shown when hovering over the large image. *(Note: not visible in all presence types)*  
- **Small Image Key** â†’ A smaller image displayed on top of the large image.  
- **Small Image Text (Hover)** â†’ Text shown when hovering over the small image.  
- **Buttons** â†’ Add up to two buttons (e.g. "View Track" / "My Profile").  

 **Important:**  
- Some fields (like *Large Image Hover Text*) do not appear in certain presence types such as *Playing* or *Watching*.  
- Configured buttons are **only visible to other people**, not to yourself in your own Discord client.
